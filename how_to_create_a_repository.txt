1) create a repository in github.com after logging into your account.

2) copy the URL of the remote repository
https://github.com/jagasia/training.git

3) in local computer, choose one folder as local repository

	d:\jag\training
 
4) go to cmd prompt in this location

	assuming there are atleast 1 file(s) in this location
 
commands for 1st time (after installing git)

	i) git config --global  user.email rjagadeeswaran@yahoo.com

	ii) git config --global user.name jagasia
 
commands for one time (for any local repository)

	i) git init

	ii) git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/training.git

	iii) git add .

	iv) git commit -m "first commit"

	v) git push origin master

		if suppose you want your name as branch then instead of above (v) command

			git branch -M jag

			git push -u origin jag
 
	first time when you push, it will ask authorization

		you can use browser authorization and come back to cmd prompt and see that it is successful.

	vi) check github and refresh

suppose i have added 5 files in local folder
but only 1 file i want to upload to remote
	git add <<filename>>
	continue commit and push commands
